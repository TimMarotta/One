        ' up at ',
        ' and ', ' for their ', ' with the ', ' their ', ' ', ' and ', ' from their ', '. Then, every ',

        ', and most importantly—their ', '. They would do anything to make sure that their ',
        ' was safe and healthy. Then, one night, there was a ', ' ', '. The ',
        ' sky filled with light briefly as a massive ', ' ', ' over the ', '. The ', ' hammered the roof of ',
        '’s little cottage. An intense ', ' woke ', ' from their sleep. It wasn’t ',
        ' before I went to bed, they thought. Just as they woke, they could hear a ', ' ', ' come from their ',
        ' pen. ',
        ' rushed out of bed and got on their ', ' and their ', ' and went to check on their ',
        's. “There, there” they told the ',
        's as they entered the coop “It’s only a little rain! There’s nothing to worry about.” ',
        ' stayed with their ', 's for a while and made sure that they were safe. They checked the ',
        ' of the coop to make sure it was secure. ', ' poured the ',
        's some more feed and went back to bed. Oh my, they thought, It’s ',
        '! I have to get to bed now so I can get up at ', ' to make ', '. As the ', ' slowed and the sun rose, ',
        ' slept, and they slept, and they slept. Finally, ',
        ' opened their eyes and rolled over to look at their clock. The clock read ', '! ',
        ' was going to be late for work! They ',
        ' out of bed and began to get dressed. They kissed their spouse as they slept and began to ', ' a ',
        '. They left it ', ' the ', ' ', ' where their spouse slept. They placed the ', ' on the ',
        ' and ran out of the ', ' and down the side of the ', '. ',
        ' knew their path like the back of their hand. They traveled the same way down the ', ' every ', ', every ',
        ' and ', ' catalogued in their brain. What ',
        ' didn’t know was that a big divot in the ground formed overnight when a ', ' fell in the ',
        ' and rolled down the hill. The divot was covered by some ', ' and some ',
        ', so it looked as if nothing was there. Suddenly, they tripped and fell into the hole in the ground. Pain '
        'shot through ',
        '’s ', ' and they let out a resounding ',
        '. They tried to get up to continue down the path, but to no avail. ', ' had injured their ',
        ' and they watched it lay there ', '. Luckily, a woman traveling back up the ', ' saw ',
        ' lying on the ground and stopped her ', '. The ', ' to her ', ' flew open and she rushed out toward ',
        '’s side. “Oh no! Are you okay?” she asked. “I wish! I just fell and I can no longer walk. I need to get '
        'down to my ',
        ' to make so I can ', ' some ', ', can you help me?” ',
        ' pleaded. “I may have something for you.” the woman said as she reached into her ', ' and pulled out a ',
        ' bottle filled with a ', ' ',
        '. “I carry this healing potion with me just in case I begin to feel faint, but I am willing to give it to '
        'you if you answer one question: what is the most important thing in your life?” “That’s easy! It’s my ',
        ', they’re the whole reason I’m in this mess in the first place.” ',
        ' explains to the woman that they had been rushing to ', ' ', ' so their ', ' could afford to ', ' for the ',
        '. “Perfect! I was worried when you spoke about work that you were only motivated by money, my potion only '
        'works on those who hold their loved ones closest to their heart. I will give you my potion so you can go to '
        'the ',
        '.” The woman uncorked the glass vial and handed it to ',
        '. Slowly, they drank the potion and began to feel a whizzing sensation through their body. Their ',
        ' began to move, and they regained their strength. The woman helped ', ' to get up and dust themselves off. ',
        ' thanked the woman and they began on their way down the ', ' as the woman smiled and returned to her ',
        '. In the end, ', ' got to their ', ' just on time to ', ' ', ' to buy some food for their ',
